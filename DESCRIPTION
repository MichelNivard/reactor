Description: Reactor notebooks are web-based documents that combine R code, plots, interactive widgets, and markdown.
  A notebook is made up of cells containing R code. If a cell is updated, all of the cells that depend on its value
  are automatically rerun. The notebooks are non-linear: it automatically figures out the order in which the cells need to be run,
  like a spreadsheet. For example, a cell could define an R variable as the output of an HTML slider, and another cell could
  make a plot based on that value. When the user moves the slider, the plot automatically redraws itself based on the new value.
  ReactiveNotebooks are useful for creating interactive explorations and visualisations of complex subjects.
